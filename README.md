• AI-Powered C/C++ Static Code Analyzer with Auto-Fix

🔍 Overview



This project is an automated C/C++ code audit tool that:



Detects insecure coding patterns



Categorizes issues by severity (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)



Blocks commits based on severity



Automatically fixes simple vulnerabilities



Re-validates code after fixing



• Features



-Static code scanning

- Rule-based security detection

- JSON report generation

- Severity-based build failure

- Auto-remediation (--fix mode)

- Git pre-commit integration



🛠 Supported Vulnerabilities



gets() usage



strcpy() usage



Format string risks



Extendable via rules.json



▶ How to Run

Basic Scan

python main.py



Auto Fix Mode

python main.py --fix



Generate JSON Report

python main.py --json



• Pre-Commit Integration



Update:
.git/hooks/pre-commit





Add:

python main.py --fix


This prevents insecure code from being committed.

📊 Example Output

AUTO FIX MODE ENABLED

Fixed issues in sample\_code/test.c

Re-scanning after auto-fix...

Build PASSED.



📈 Future Improvements

Advanced pattern detection

AI-based contextual fixes

VS Code extension integration

CI/CD pipeline support

:

🎯 Problem solved:

C/C++ code has security issues that compilers often miss — this tool finds them automatically.

- Modular Design:
scanner → rule engine → reporter → auto-fix → CI

-Extensibility:
Rules are JSON, so new checks can be added without changing code.

- CI Integration:
GitHub Actions runs analysis on every push/PR → this helps enforce quality early.

- Future Scope:
Add AST-based parsing, improve rule detection, integrate VS Code plugin.
